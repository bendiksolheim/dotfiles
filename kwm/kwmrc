# This is a sample config for Kwm

# Commands prefixed with 'kwmc' will call
# local functions corresponding to the
# kwmc syntax.

# To run a system command, use the prefix
# 'sys' and then the requested command
# e.g 'sys mvim' would open macvim

# Read file and execute commands as
# if they were written inside kwmrc.

# include filename

# e.g: bind-commands in a separate file called 'binds'
# include binds

# Create variables that can be used in the below commands.
# Variables are in file-scope and must be defined before
# they can be used. Re-definition is also possible.
# Variable names can not contain whitespace, where as
# the value can.

# define variable value

# e.g: create a variable for the hyper-key
# define hyper cmd+ctrl+alt+shift
# kwmc bind hyper-h window -f west

# Set default values for screen padding
kwmc config padding 0 0 0 0

# Set default values for container gaps
kwmc config gap 5 5

# Default tiling mode for Kwm (bsp | monocle | float | off)
kwmc config tiling bsp

# Let Kwm listen for hotkeys
kwmc config hotkeys on

# Set prefix for Kwms hotkeys
kwmc config prefix-key ctrl-s

# Prefix is not applied globally
kwmc config prefix-global off

# Time in seconds, before prefix must be re-activated
kwmc config prefix-timeout 0.75

# Automatically float windows that fail to resize
kwmc config float-non-resizable on

# Automatically resize the window to its container
kwmc config lock-to-container on

# Set focus-follows-mouse-mode to autoraise
kwmc config focus-follows-mouse off

# Focus-follows-mouse is temporarily disabled when
# a floating window has focus
kwmc config standby-on-float on

# The mouse will automatically move to the center
# of the focused window
kwmc config mouse-follows-focus off

# Allow window focus to wrap-around
kwmc config cycle-focus screen

# Override default settings for space 1 on screen 0
# kwmc config space 0 1 mode monocle
# kwmc config space 0 1 padding 100 100 100 100
# kwmc config space 0 1 gap 40 40

# Override default settings for screen 1
# kwmc config display 1 mode bsp
# kwmc config display 1 padding 100 100 100 100
# kwmc config display 1 gap 40 40

# Set default container split-ratio
kwmc config split-ratio 0.5

# New splits become the left leaf-node
kwmc config spawn left

# Add custom tiling rules for applications that
# does not get tiled by Kwm by default.
# This is because some applications do not have the
# AXWindowRole and AXStandardWindowSubRole
kwmc config add-role AXDialog iTerm2

# The following commands create rules that
# blacklists an application from Kwms tiling
#
# kwmc rule owner="Steam" properties={float="true"}
# kwmc rule owner="Photoshop" properties={float="true"}

# The following command creates a rule that
# captures an application to the given screen,
# if the screen exists.
#
# kwmc rule owner="iTunes" properties={display="1"}

# Enable border for focused window
kwmc config focused-border on
kwmc config focused-border size 1
kwmc config focused-border color FFBDD322
kwmc config focused-border radius 0

# Enable border for marked window
kwmc config marked-border on
kwmc config marked-border size 1
kwmc config marked-border color FFCC5577
kwmc config marked-border radius 0

# Change border when prefix-key is active
